# Lamars Game

Built an interactive video game using pygame for my seven-year old niece. 

All functionality and design choices were chosen by her (in fact she drew it all out on a paper labelled 'Top Secret').

The goal for this project was to showcase to my niece the beauty and power of computer science, in the hopes that she one day takes an interest in the field.
